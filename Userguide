There are three seperated program files for this name service. For using
the name service, you should first strat nameserver and routeserver, and 
then run the client. I write the user guide for them together here.

NAME
        client      - client program of name service
        nameserver  - name server program for controlling the name server
                      nodes
        routeserver - route server program for controlling the route
                      server node

SYNOPSIS
        ./client [-aldu] [-n NAME]
        ./nameserver [OPTION]...
        ./routeserver [OPTION]...
